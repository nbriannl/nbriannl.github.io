<h1>Hi, I'm Neil Brian</h1>

<p>And I'm in my last year in National University of Singapore with a degree in Computer Science. I have a general interest to create, 
    be it as a Software Engineer contributing to products, or making a simple tool simply because I feel compelled to make my life easier. I also produce music as a hobby.
    I am more inclined to, and more familar with, working on front end. I find it very satisfying to contribute changes most visble to users and impactful to their experience.</p>
<p>I interned in HOOQ for 2 separate summer internships. HOOQ is a video on demand streaming service with markets in Southeast Asia and India.</p>
<p>For my first internship, I worked on HOOQ's progressive web application (m.hooq.tv). Some of frameworks used to build it are React, Redux, Koa and Webpack.</p>
<p>In my second time at HOOQ, I worked on the TV Application for LG and Samsung TVs, built with BBC's TV Application Layer, a Javascript Library. With the library, one can build reusable UI compnents. And with a single codebase, one can release for multiple television platforms.</p>
<p>In both internships I worked in a Scrum Team of 5-8 people, including developers and product owner. I have grown familiar working in an Angile workflow, contributing to tickets in 2-week long sprints.</p>
<p>I'm interested in Front End Engineering roles, or general Application Development roles. While the former may be a more familiar path, I like to take the experience to build apps end-to-end to develop myself.</p>
