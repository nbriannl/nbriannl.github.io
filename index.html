<h1>Hi, I'm Neil Brian</h1>

<p>And I have graduated from National University of Singapore with a degree in Computer Science. I have a general interest to <b>Create</b>. 
    Be it as a Software Engineer contributing to products, or making a <a href="https://github.com/nbriannl/oboeru-web/">tool</a> because I feel compelled to make my life easier and perhaps, maybe help other people's lives easier as well. I also produce <a href="https://soundcloud.com/br1ne">music</a> as a hobby.</p>
<p>I have been more inclined to, and more familar with, working on front end. I find it very satisfying to contribute changes most visble to users and impactful to their experience.</p>
<p>I am currently working in ESTL, part of GovTech but more accurately, a full stack-stack engineering outfit housed within the Ministry of Education. While I have been more familiar with front end development, I take any experience to build applications as a chance to develop myself.</p>
<p>I interned in HOOQ for 2 separate summer internships. HOOQ <i>was</i> a video on demand streaming service with markets in Southeast Asia and India.</p>
<p>For my first internship, I worked on HOOQ's progressive web application. Some of frameworks used to build it are React, Redux, Koa and Webpack.</p>
<p>In my second time at HOOQ, I worked on the TV Application for LG and Samsung TVs, built with BBC's TV Application Layer, a Javascript Library. With the library, one can build reusable UI compnents. And with a single codebase, one can release for multiple television platforms.</p>
<p>In both internships I worked in a Scrum Team of 5-8 people, including developers and product owner. I have grown familiar to working in an Agile workflow, having contributed to tickets in 2-week long sprints.</p>
